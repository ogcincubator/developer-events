# Nov 2024 Metadata Codesprint Report

[Preview HTML version](https://ogcincubator.github.io/developer-events/2024/Metadata-Codesprint-Nov24/discussion_paper/document.html)

## Introduction
The OGC GeoDCAT SWG (with the OGC MetaCata DWG) ran a two day code sprint, as described at https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/tree/main/workshops/2024/OGC_Metadata_Codesprint
A lot of possible work items had been proposed as issues (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues) in that repository & as comments on one specific issue (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17). With two developers in the room, two in the Americas and the promise of some joining from Europe, it seemed that the favourite topic areas were:
* alignment with PROV - GeoDCAT & PROV or OGC API Records & PROV 
* metadata for AI / OGC API Processes & Large Language Models (#18)(
* ISO 19115-1 to (Geo)DCAT mapping 

This repository contains a report using the OGC Discussion Paper format (Metanorma toolchain).

## Use of PROV in GeoDCAT & OGC API Record
Developers: 
See https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/24
Could be as part of a OGC API Records GeoDCAT response (https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2434553700, https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2444035107, https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2477705703)

## ISO 19115-1 to GeoDCAT mapping
Developers: David (USA Pacific coast); Jeroen (Europe)
See https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2477907159, which could inform https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17#issuecomment-2376563378

ISO/TC 211 seems keen to publish an ISO 19115-1:2014 to GeoDCAT mapping during 2025; this could either be a Technical Specification ("normative" i.e. with requirements so it's possible to conform to) or a Technical Report (informative, no requirements etc, but a "line in the sand"). Either would then be revised when ISO 19115-1:2014 is revised (probably during 2026/2027) or when better consensus emerges on good practice.

Background:
A lot of 'prior art' exists, mapping from various editions of ISO 19115 (or at least subsets of them) to DCAT v2 or v3:
* W3C draft mapping from ISO 19115:2003 (unknown subset) to DCAT v2: [https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/ISO_19115_-_DCAT_-_Schema.org_mapping ](https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/ISO_19115_-_DCAT_-_Schema.html)
* EU mapping from ISO 19139 (encoding of ISO 19115:2003) (EU INSPIRE subset) to EU GeoDCAT-AP (an AP of DCAT v2): https://github.com/GeoCat/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/blob/master/documentation/Mappings.md
* UK (draft) mapping from ISO 19115:2003 (EU INSPIRE subset) to DCAT v3: https://github.com/agiorguk/gemini/issues/41 (less detailed than above)
* implementations (XSLT) in GeoNetwork microservices e.g. https://github.com/geonetwork/geonetwork-microservices/tree/main/modules/services/ogc-api-records/src/main/resources/xslt/ogcapir/formats/copy for ISO 19115-1:2014 / ISO 19115-3 (UK / INSPIRE subset) to DCAT v3
